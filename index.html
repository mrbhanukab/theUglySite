      Sputnik 1 (/ˈspʌtnɪk, ˈspʊtnɪk/; see § Etymology) was the first artificial
      Earth satellite.[5] It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by
      the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It
      sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks before its three
      silver-zinc batteries ran out. Aerodynamic drag caused it to fall back
      into the atmosphere on 4 January 1958. It was a polished metal sphere 58
      cm (23 in) in diameter with four external radio antennas to broadcast
      radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable by amateur radio
      operators,[6] and the 65° orbital inclination made its flight path cover
      virtually the entire inhabited Earth. The satellite's unanticipated
      success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space
      Race, part of the Cold War. The launch was the beginning of a new era of
      political, military, technological and scientific developments.[7][8] The
      word sputnik is Russian for traveller when interpreted in an astronomical
      context;[9] its other meanings are spouse or traveling companion.[10][11]
      Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with
      valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced
      from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave
      data about the ionosphere. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International
      Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh
      SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite traveled at a
      peak speed of about 8 km/s (18,000 mph), taking 96.20 minutes to complete
      each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[12] which were
      monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued
      for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.
      Sputnik 1 burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere,
      after three months, 1,440 completed orbits of the Earth,[2] and a distance
      traveled of about 70,000,000 km (43,000,000 mi).[13]

  <p>here are some common design principles that are generally considered to be good practice, which you could use as a starting point for your learning exercise:

Consistent typography: Consistency in typography helps create a visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to scan and read the content.

Simple color scheme: Using a simple and limited color palette can help create a cohesive look and feel.

Clear navigation: Providing clear navigation allows users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

Accessible layout: A website's layout should be easy to scan, read, and interact with, regardless of the user's device or ability.

High-quality images: Using high-quality images can enhance the visual appeal of a website and create an emotional connection with the user.

Fast loading speed: Websites should be optimized for speed, to ensure users can access information quickly without being kept waiting.

Mobile responsiveness: Websites should be designed to work well on a variety of screen sizes and devices.</p>
